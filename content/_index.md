## What is Customer Identity and Access Management (cIAM)?

It is a platform for business process and policies that facilitate management of digital identities. We use this to control user access to critical information in an enterprise. It helps securely store profile data and even provides data governance functions to ensure only necessary data is shared.

CIAM solutions usually provide a combination of features which may include customer registration, self-service account management, consent and preference management, a single sign-on solution (SSO), a multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution, access management, authorization, directory services, data access governance, identity proofing, identity orchestration, and even threat detection and fraud mitigation.

Here at Maersk, we use federated identities which can be translated to a system where a user can access multiple platforms and services with a single set of credentials.

### What does cIAM look after?

- How individuals are identified in a system
- How roles are identified in a system and they are assigned to individuals
- adding, removing, and updating individuals and their roles
- assigning levels of access
- protecting sensitive information within the system and securing system itself

### How many components does cIAM have?

![IAM Components](cluster-diag.png)

**1. Access Management (AM):** AM provides a service called access management, which manages access to resources, such as a web page, an application, or a web service, that are available over the network. Once it is set up, AM provides an infrastructure for managing users, roles, and access to resources. AM centralizes access control by handling both authentication and authorization.

**2. Identity Management (IDM):** Identity Management (IDM) software provides centralized, simple management and synchronization of identities for users, devices, and things. IDM software is highly flexible and therefore able to fit almost any use case and workflow. IDM can make it easier to track user identities across these resources. IDM has a highly scalable, modular, readily deployable architecture that can help you manage workflows and user information.

**3. Directory Services (DS):** They are specialized software systems or databases designed to store, organize, and manage information about users, resources, and their relationships within an organization. These services provide a centralized repository for user identities, access control policies, and related information. Directory services are used to facilitate efficient authentication, authorization, and access management across various IT resources.

## Benefits of Identity and Access Management

IAM offers a wide range of benefits to organizations of all sizes by helping them manage and secure user identities, permissions, and access to their systems and data. Here are some key benefits of IAM:

| 14. Risk Mitigation:                                | IAM helps mitigate the risk of insider threats and external attacks by ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and systems.                                                                                                                     |
|                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In summary, IAM is a crucial component of modern cybersecurity and access control strategies, providing organizations with enhanced security, compliance, efficiency, and control over user access. It helps organizations protect their data, streamline user management processes, and adapt to changing security needs and regulatory requirements.
